### Initialize the command shortcut

This will link the rvn command into a local bin directory which is on
your PATH. If you don't have such a directory on your PATH, it will
extend PATH by modifying one of your profile files.

```
> cd <this repo dir>
> bin/rvn init
finding local bin directory...
found '/Users/tlilley/.local/bin'
linking rvn into '/Users/tlilley/.local/bin'...
done
>
```
